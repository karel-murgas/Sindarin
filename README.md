# Sindarin
This project is meant to add some interactiveness to process of learning Neo Sindarin language.

Phase one: Program the grammar rules (mutations, plurals, etc.)

Phase two: Add exercises to practice Sindarin

Phase three: Create website utilizing these exercises and grammar rules

Phase four: Profit :-)

All the grammar rules are based on Xandariel's Sindarin Lessons website (sindrarinlessons.weebly.com).
